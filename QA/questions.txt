Difference Between Verification and Validation in Software Testing with Example

Verification in Software Testing is a process of checking documents, design, code, and program in order to check if the software has been built according to the requirements or not

Validation in Software Engineering is a dynamic mechanism of testing and validating if the software product actually meets the exact needs of the customer or not. The process helps to ensure that the software fulfills the desired use in an appropriate environment.

Difference between Defect, Error and Bug

Defect is the difference observed between expected behaviour and the actual results 
current product does not correspond to the customer`s requirements

Error
n software engineer error can have two definitions: it can be a programming mistake generated due to incorrect loops or wrong syntax, and an error expected from customer`s requirements.

error : programing mistake created by software developer

Bug
Once the product is completed and it is delivered to the customers and if the customer find any issues in product or software then this condition should be called as a `bug`. People widely say the bug is an informal name for the defect.bugg  In other words, if an end user finds an issue in product then that particular issue is called as bug.

positive test
software works according to requirement.  works as expected

negative test
make sure software can gracefully handle invalid input or unexpected user behavior

smoke test
test after build.  shallow and wide range testing insure stability of build

sanity test
test after smoke test and regression test.  narrow and deep testing of new feacture or fix added to the build

tatic Testing vs Dynamic Testing

Static Testing (requirement verification) is a type of software testing in which software application is tested without code execution. Manual or automated reviews of code, requirement documents and document design are done in order to find the errors. The main objective of static testing is to improve the quality of software applications by finding errors in early stages of software development process.

Requirement specifications
Design document
Source Code
Test Plans
Test Cases
Test Scripts

Under Dynamic Testing (requirement validation), a code is executed. It checks for functional behavior of software system, memory/cpu usage and overall performance of the system. Hence the name "Dynamic"

The main objective of this testing is to confirm that the software product works in conformance with the business requirements. This testing is also called an Execution technique or validation testing.
