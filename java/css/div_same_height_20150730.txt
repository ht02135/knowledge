This is an area where CSS has never really had any solutions — you’re down to using <table> tags 
(or faking them using the CSS display:table* values), as that’s the only place where a “keep a 
bunch of elements the same height” was implemented.

<div style="display: table-row;">

    <div style="border:1px solid #cccccc; display: table-cell;">
        Some content!<br/>
        Some content!<br/>
        Some content!<br/>
        Some content!<br/>
        Some content!<br/>
    </div>

    <div style="border:1px solid #cccccc;  display: table-cell;">
        Some content!
    </div>

</div>
