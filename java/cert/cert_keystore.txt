Tomcat currently operates only on JKS, PKCS11 or PKCS12 format keystores

The JKS format is Java's standard "Java KeyStore" format, and is the format created by the keytool command-line utility. This tool is included in the JDK. The PKCS12 format is an internet standard, and can be manipulated via (among other things) OpenSSL and Microsoft's Key-Manager.

Each entry in a keystore is identified by an alias string. Whilst many keystore implementations treat aliases in a case insensitive manner, case sensitive implementations are available.

To import an existing certificate signed by your own CA into a PKCS12 keystore using OpenSSL you would execute a command like:
	
openssl pkcs12 -export -in mycert.crt -inkey mykey.key
                        -out mycert.p12 -name tomcat -CAfile myCA.crt
                        -caname root -chain

Installing a Certificate from a Certificate Authority
To obtain and install a Certificate from a Certificate Authority (like verisign.com, thawte.com or trustcenter.de)   

In order to obtain a Certificate from the Certificate Authority of your choice you have to create a so called Certificate Signing Request (CSR). That CSR will be used by the Certificate Authority to create a Certificate that will identify your website as "secure". To create a CSR follow these steps:

Create a local self-signed Certificate (as described in the previous section):
		
keytool -genkey -alias tomcat -keyalg RSA
    -keystore <your_keystore_filename>

The CSR is then created with:
		
	
keytool -certreq -keyalg RSA -alias tomcat -file certreq.csr
    -keystore <your_keystore_filename>

Now you have a file called certreq.csr that you can submit to the Certificate Authority (look at the documentation of the Certificate Authority website on how to do this). In return you get a Certificate.		

///////

mporting the Certificate
Now that you have your Certificate you can import it into you local keystore. First of all you have to import a so called Chain Certificate or Root Certificate into your keystore

Download a Chain Certificate from the Certificate Authority you obtained the Certificate from.
For Verisign.com commercial certificates go to: http://www.verisign.com/support/install/intermediate.html
For Verisign.com trial certificates go to: http://www.verisign.com/support/verisign-intermediate-ca/Trial_Secure_Server_Root/index.html
For Trustcenter.de go to: http://www.trustcenter.de/certservices/cacerts/en/en.htm#server
For Thawte.com go to: http://www.thawte.com/certs/trustmap.html
Import the Chain Certificate into your keystore
		
keytool -import -alias root -keystore <your_keystore_filename>
    -trustcacerts -file <filename_of_the_chain_certificate>

And finally import your new Certificate
		
keytool -import -alias tomcat -keystore <your_keystore_filename>
    -file <your_certificate_filename>
