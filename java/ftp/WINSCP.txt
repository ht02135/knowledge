WinSCP has a setting enabled by default that transfers files larger than 100kb to a temporary file name (with the .filepart extension) and then renames the file. The original file transfer is being recognized as an upload and it’s moving the file before WinSCP has a chance to rename the file. The easiest fix is to disable this feature in WinSCP.

Click Options > Preferences.
In the Preferences dialog box, click to expand the Transfer node, then click Endurance.
Under Enable transfer resume/transfer to temporary filename for, click Disable.
Click OK to save the changes.

Transfer was successfully finished, but temporary transfer file ... could not be renamed to target file name ...

With SFTP protocol, when automatic transfer resume is enabled, WinSCP first uploads the file to a temporary file with .filepart extension. Only after the transfer is completed the file is renamed to its actual name.

For you the renaming failed, for which there are many possible reasons including:
1>Your SFTP server does not support renaming files;
2>There’s some process that takes the uploaded file away immediately, before WinSCP is able to rename it.
3>There’s antivirus (or similar application) that starts inspecting the uploaded file, locking it while doing that, what conflicts with WinSCP attempt to rename the file.
