follow steps  to remove the keywords here & you from STOPLIST
1>Copied the system stop word list to a new 'alohaDefaultStoplist' in the erie_user_testnew database:
  CREATE FULLTEXT STOPLIST alohaDefaultStoplist FROM SYSTEM STOPLIST;
2>use ms sql server management studio to drop words: here & you
  action: delete stop word
  stop word: here & you
3>I then associated the new stoplist with the aloha_search full-text index:
  ALTER FULLTEXT INDEX ON aloha_search SET STOPLIST alohaDefaultStoplist

To prevent a full-text index from becoming bloated, SQL Server has a mechanism that discards commonly occurring strings that do not help the search. These discarded strings are called stopwords. During index creation, the Full-Text Engine omits stopwords from the full-text index. This means that full-text queries will not search on stopwords
