SET

1>Can only assign one variable at a time.

SET @Index = 1
SET @LoopCount = 10
SET @InitialValue = 5

2>When assigning from a query and the query returns no result, SET will assign a NULL value to the variable.

DECLARE @CustomerID NCHAR(5)
SET @CustomerID = 'XYZ'
SET @CustomerID = (SELECT [CustomerID]
                   FROM [dbo].[Customers]
                   WHERE [CustomerID] = 'ABC')
SELECT @CustomerID -– Returns NULL

3>When assigning from a query that returns more than one value, SET will fail with an error.



SET = (SELECT [CustomerID]
       FROM [dbo].[Customers])

Msg 512, Level 16, State 1, Line 3
Subquery returned more than 1 value. 
This is not permitted when the subquery
follows =, !=, <, <= , >, >= or when the 
subquery is used as an expression.

SELECT

1>Can assign values to more than one variable at a time.

SELECT @Index = 1, @LoopCount = 10,
       @InitialValue = 5

2>When assigning from a query and the query returns no result, SELECT will not make the assignment and therefore not change the value of the variable.

DECLARE @CustomerID NCHAR(5)
SET @CustomerID = 'XYZ'
SELECT @CustomerID = [CustomerID]
FROM [dbo].[Customers]
WHERE [CustomerID] = 'ABC'
SELECT @CustomerID –- Returns XYZ

3>When assigning from a query that returns more than one value, SELECT will assign the last value returned by the query and hide the fact that the query returned more than one row.

SELECT  @CustomerID = [CustomerID]
FROM [dbo].[Customers]
-- No error generated
