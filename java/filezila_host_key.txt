If you use the standard openssh console client (cygwin or from linux), host keys are stored, one-per-line, in ~/.ssh/known_hosts. From there, it's a simple matter of figuring out which bit of that host key is needed for your library.

Putty also stores host keys, but it appears to encode them in hex. Those can be found at HKCUR\Software\SimonTatham\PuTTY\SshHostKeys

Thomas was correct. FileZilla piggybacks on PuTTY's PSFTP program and stores the saved keys encoded in a hex format at the registry key he listed (HKCUR\Software\SimonTatham\PuTTY\SshHostKeys). I needed the key in known_hosts format, so I has able to install a windows version of openssh at his recommendation and used the ssh-keyscan tool to hit the server and save the key info out in the correct format:

ssh-keyscan -t rsa <my_ftp_ip_address> > c:\known_hosts
ssh-keyscan -t dsa <my_ftp_ip_address> > c:\known_hosts

filezila, when it connect to ftp site via sftp port 22, it need host key of ftp site.

filezila uses putty to save host key of ftp site.  you need to use putty to add new host key for the ftp host you want to connect to
