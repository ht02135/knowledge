Raygun (raygun.io) is a cloud-based error tracking system that can be used from a variety of development platforms. The following are steps for adding Raygun to your Web API application.
1. Get API Key

    Login to your Raygun account (raygun.io)
    Add a new application or navigate to existing application
    Select Application Settings and copy the API key

2. Install NuGet Package

    From the Package Manager Console in Visual Studio, run the following command:

    Install-Package WebApiContrib.Logging.Raygun

3. Add API Key to Web.config

    Add your API key to <appSettings> in the web.config file:

    <add key="RaygunAppKey" value="API_KEY" />

4. Add Raygun Exception Logger

    Add the following code to WebApiConfig.cs:

    config.Services.Add(typeof (IExceptionLogger), new RaygunExceptionLogger());

That's it. Try it out by throwing an exception in one of your controllers and verify it is logged to Raygun.
