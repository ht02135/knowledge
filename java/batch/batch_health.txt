say you installed batchApp instance on TEST29c at port 8147.

but you tried http://TEST29C:8147/ to test health and cant access.  it might be some other process is running on that port 8147

1>netstat -ano | findstr :8147

to find out
  TCP    0.0.0.0:8147           0.0.0.0:0              LISTENING       5420
  TCP    [::]:8147              [::]:0                 LISTENING       5420
  
you see PID=5420 process is running on port 8147
  
2>taskkill /pid 5420 /f

to kill PID=5420 process
