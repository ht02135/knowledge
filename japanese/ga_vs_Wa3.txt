Because は and が are interchangeable! As a matter of fact, it is often grammatically correct to 
switch them around, but in doing so you will change the meaning of that sentence.

Typically, when you use は you are making a more general statement about who is performing an 
action than when you use が.

が implies that the one who is performing that action is the only one doing it. In other words, が 
implies definiteness

1>ga
if you want to insist on paying for dinner for everyone, you will say 私が払います(わたしが はらいます)

2>wa
If you are only paying for your own dinner and you do not expect to pay for everyone else as well, 
you would say 私は払います (わたしは はらいます)

1. Declaring the topic of a sentence

For English speakers, it is very difficult to understand は because we do not have anything quite like
it in our language. が on the other hand makes some sense to us. This is because subjects exist in English, 
while topics are not really a grammatical construct.

When you have some sentence “A はB” you can think of this sentence as describing something inside a closed 
room. We can imagine that this room contains everything related to A. By saying “A はB” we indicate that 
B is one of the things that goes on inside that room.

So, take for instance 私は学生です (わたしは がくせいです –  I am a student). The topic is 私 (I), so that 
sentence can be read as “there is a student inside the room which contains everything related to me.” Oh, 
okay, I guess you are a student then. But here you could still make a sensible sentence using が, so why 
does it even matter?

Well, we can put other things into that room as well. Take the sentence ゾウは鼻が長いです (ぞうは はながながいです), 
which means “An elephant has a long trunk.” If a sentence like this is translated word for word we get something 
like “An elephant, a trunk is long.” Which is, of course, completely different from what we want to say.

2. Topic and subject in the same sentence

One of the first sentences I learned in Japanese was 京都にはお寺が多い (きょうとには おてらがおおい – There are many 
temples in Kyoto). Here we see another common usage of  は and が. They appear in a sentence with the structure 
“topic はsubject が action.”

You can roughly think of it as saying “in the context of topic, subject does action.” In the example above, 
“in Kyoto” is the topic and the subject is “temples.”

3. Using が to place emphasis

When you use が you are usually talking about something in particular rather than something in general. If you have 
the sentence お母さんが。。。(おかあさんが。。。-  Mother is…) then you are talking about one person in particular. 
Emphasis is placed on the person doing an action rather than the action itself.

4. Known and unknown subjects

Whenever someone or something is introduced for the first time, we introduce that new person or thing with が, even 
if it otherwise makes sense to use は in that context.

For instance: 今日、先生が来る。彼は優しい人らしい。(きょう、せんせいがくる。かれは やさしいひとらしい。- Today, the teacher 
is coming. He sounds like a kind person.)

が places emphasis on the object or person being introduced. が tells us that we are talking about one person in 
particular rather than a general concept

You can use は right away after he has been introduced.

5. Asking and answering questions

When the subject of a sentence is an unknown, it is paired with が
誰が来る？(だれがくる？-  who is coming?)
In any case, just try to remember to use が. When answering the question, you should also always use が

6. Contrasting and comparing

When contrasting sentences against each other you should use は. For example: クラッシックは聞きますが、ジャズは聞きません (くらっしっくは ききますが
