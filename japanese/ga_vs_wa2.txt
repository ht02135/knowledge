A few notes about the topic:
1>The topic is often the same as the subject, but not always.
2>It is sometimes compared to the English expressions “As for ~” or “Speaking of ~”

---------------

Asking Questions: wa (は) or ga (が)?

1>the question word doko (where) comes after the topic
toire wa, doko desu ka?
Where is the bathroom?

2>When a question word is or is part of the subject
dare ga kimasu ka?
Who will come?

Use ga (が) when information about a subject is important or situationally new to the listener and/or the speaker.
 
Once the subject has been mentioned, wa (は) is used to refer to the same subject in sentences following (it becomes the topic of the sentence.)

/////////////////////////

Using the particle wa (は) to show contrast

肉は食べますが、魚は食べません。
Niku wa tabemasu ga, sakana wa tabemasen.
I eat meat, but I don’t eat fish.

In this usage, the thing that is being contrasted is not always stated, but it is implied
あの映画は見ませんでした。
Ano eiga wa mimasen deshita.
I didn’t see that movie (but I saw this one).

Using the particle ga (が) as emphasis

Ga (が) can also be used to emphasize the subject or distinguish it from others
私がサラです。
Watashi ga Sara desu.
I am (the one who is) Sara

////////////

The particle ga (が) can be used to connect two sentences as but.
行きたいですが、お金がないです。
Ikitai desu ga, okane ga nai desu.
I want to go but I don’t have money.
