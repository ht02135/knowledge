は (wa) is the topic marker and が (ga) is the subject marker.

Topic: a non-grammatical context for the whole sentence.
Subject: a grammatical relationship only to the verb.

The number one difference is that while a subject has a explicit grammatical role 
(the thing which does the verb), a topic is just like a big cloud, with no set relationship 
to what’s actually going on in the sentence; it’s just there, floating around the sentence.

Since we only ever have subjects in English (never topics) it still takes some getting used 
to before you can accurately distinguish where we should use one or the other

---------------

A は B.
は marks a topic–something non-grammatically related to the sentence–you can think of it like
a picture frame. The thing は marks surrounds and labels the sentence, but is largely independent 
of what goes on inside. は is a good describer and observer

------------

A が B
が–in contrast to は–is much more involved in the sentence. It’s almost like a conqueror. Words
marked with が stake their claim on the sentence (and the verb in particular), making a definite 
claim of ownership.

///////////////

in Japanese, there is rarely ever a sentence that becomes grammatically incorrect if you chose は when you should have said が or vice versa. The error that arises from misusing these particles is that you convey the wrong meaning.

since は marks a topic, information that while important does not have a definite grammatical role, it is much less central to the message of a sentence than a が marked subject
 
watashi ga kuruma o unten shimashita. (I drove the car.)
 
watashi wa, kuruma o unten shimashita. (I, drove the car.)

In fact, in written Japanese, the particle は is often followed by a comma, but が almost never is
